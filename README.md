This project offers multiple nodes which integrate Pilot Things and Node-RED one another.

Currently, we offer nodes that allow Node-RED to submit data to the Pilot Things platform for storage or decoding (the decoded result can then be used in the flow for other purposes).

After installing this NPM package in `~/.node-red` and restarting your Node-RED instance, you should see the nodes appear under the category "pilot things".
